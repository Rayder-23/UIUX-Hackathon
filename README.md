# Hello, Please go through README.
My name is Ryyan Abdullah, (Roll No. 65355), I was a Senior Student in Q1 and am now purposely a regular student as my responsibilities at home have increased and can no longer devote the time to be a Senior Student/Leader. I missed the last Hackathon as I was not aware/confused as to what to do.

I am taking this project as a test of my skills that I have picked up from the Governor IT Program, under the teaching of Sir Hamzah Syed.

My approach was a very modular one using components, I didn't make the practice template beforehand, which in hindsight was a great error as I now realise that 24 hours is not enough (for me atleast) to make serveral pages and style each and every one of them, but I have tried my best, my focus has been on "Pixel Perfect" and "adherence to the Figma Template" as my main goals.

You may have told me to take the points penalty to take the extension but I have a very busy week ahead of me, and I know I will not be able to take full advantage of the extension. Believe me I find this very fun, it is a great exercise that you all have planned and it has reignited a passion to code again. If you did read all this, I thank you and hope that you recognize my efforts and time constraints.
